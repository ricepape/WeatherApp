# Ohjelmointi 3 projektin tietovarasto

Tämä on ryhmäsi yhteinen tietovarasto projektin tekemistä varten. Huomaa, että nyt
projektissa on useita jäseniä ja tekemisesi vaikuttaa muiden työhön. Liitä harjoitustyön
materiaalien etätietovarasto (https://course-gitlab.tuni.fi/compcs140-fall2023/group_template_project)
paikalliseen tietovarastoosi remoteksi, jotta voit ladata kurssin tarjoamaa materiaalia.

Tätä tiedostoa saa (ja on hyväkin) muuttaa projektin aloittamisen jälkeen.

# Programming 3 project repository

This is the repository for implementing the course project for your group. Note that
your project now has several members and what you do impacts other's work. Add the remote
repository for the project material (https://course-gitlab.tuni.fi/compcs140-fall2023/group_template_project)
as a remote to your local repository to fetch the code provided by the course.

You are allowed (and probably should) make changes to this file after you have started your project.

# Programming 3 project - Weather App

# What is this project?
This is the final project of Programming 3 course - a JavaFX Weather Application. It allows users to check the current
weather and receive forecast for the next hours or days depending on the location. Often viewed locations can be saved
as favorites and the last viewed location appears every time the app is opened. The project connects to OpenWeatherApp's
API and was built using maven.

# What needs to be done?
<ul>
<li>Fetch data about weather from a public API</li>
<li>Data is returned in JSON, so we also have to parse and read JSON object</li>
<li>Build GUI for the app</li>
<li>Code functions</li>
<li>Build unit testing</li>
<li>Write documentation</li>
</ul>

# What can be learned from this project?
<ul>
<li>How to use public API with key in a Java project</li>
<li>Team working and planning</li>
<li>How to parse and read JSON objects</li>
</ul>

# Work division and progress

Our group is group 3221. Members are Thi Vu and Anh Tran.

Thi Vu is mainly responsible for dealing with API of OpenWeatherApp and writing the code for WeatherApp.
Anh Tran works on building WeatherAppGui and compiling documentation for this project. Two branches were
created on group git to update code from local repositories, then they are checked before adding to the
main branch of group git. Our branches are Thi-Vu and AnhTran.

GUI was built using SceneBuilder. IDEs used are NetBeans and IntelliJ IDEA.
